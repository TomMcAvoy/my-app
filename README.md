# my-app
Building a distributed hybrid structure with concurrency to redis using redlock and journal logging  the idea is to build a hybrid structure allowing traversal and all those best computer science courses . Then build the mearn stack as first stage. Communications inplement kafka - node are encrpted into JWE   - keys rotated , multiple keys for historic versioning authentication and authorization controlled by from end api gateway  - express gateway using oidc .
Writing generic AVL tree uuid, any  allows us to build datastructure expandable to any use case 
so essentally we have an expandable datastructure . AVL in local cache ,  kafka partitioned to process owner  and redis 
backing up the AVL tree ... simple matter to switch data structures to DAG or UDAG if needed - all records encrypted with one way pad  - data in transit doubly encrypted .  Analytics data feed via same system for metric and telemetry 
that the beautiful thing about decorators and generics ... use case -- financials , big data analysis , credit card processing ... you name it an any is an any

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
