# my-app

Our goal is to build a distributed hybrid architecture with concurrency control using Redlock and journal logging. This architecture will support efficient traversal and incorporate best practices from computer science. The initial phase involves developing a MEAN stack application.

Key Components:
Concurrency Control: Utilize Redlock for distributed locking to ensure data consistency across Redis.
Journal Logging: Implement journal logging for reliable data recovery and auditing.
MEAN Stack: Develop the initial application using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.
Kafka Integration: Use Kafka for communication between services. Messages will be encrypted into JSON Web Encryption (JWE) format, with key rotation and multiple keys for historical versioning.
Authentication and Authorization: Controlled via an API gateway (Express Gateway) using OpenID Connect (OIDC).
Data Structures: Implement a generic AVL tree with UUIDs, allowing for an expandable data structure adaptable to various use cases. The AVL tree will be cached locally, with Kafka partitioned by process owner and Redis backing up the AVL tree.
Encryption: All records will be encrypted using a one-way pad, with data in transit doubly encrypted.
Analytics and Telemetry: The same system will be used for metrics and telemetry, leveraging decorators and generics for flexibility.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
